    "> An aside on the difference between e.g., `int8`, `int16`, `int32`. The number here refers to the number of bits used to represent each integer. For example, `int8` is an integer represented with one byte (one byte = 8 bits). Recall that bits are the basic unit of information \"0/1\" used by computers. So the maximum *unsigned* number that can be held with an `int8` datatype is: 2^8 (but because Python indexes from 0, the unsigned range of `int8` is 0 to 257). If we wish to have negative numbers, we need to use one of those bits to represent the sign, and we are left with 2^7 bits to make numbers with, and so the signed range of `int8` is -128 to +127. Likewise, `int16` has an unsigned range of 0 to 65,535 (2^16), or a signed range of -32,768 to +32,767, etc. It's interesting to watch what happens if you try to use a dtype that does not support the number you wish to store:"

Once we've used the first 6 elements, we traverse a dimensional \"slice\" and use the next 6 element to fill that 2D slice. We then repeat that one more time for the last \"slice\".\n",

    "Briefly, NumPy uses \"row-major\" indexing when reading data from memory which basically means that \"grouping\" starts from the left most index. So for a 2D array, the order is `(row, column)`, for a 3D array the order is `(depth, row, column)`, for a 4D array it is `(4th dimension, depth, row, column)`, etc. The way I think about this is that the ndarray is a container, in the 3D case I think of a cube made up of stacked matrices. I can enter this for container (\"dimension\") and view a matrix. The next container is a \"row\" of values which comprises one smaller container for each \"column\". There are two overarching styles that dictate the way data is read in from memory, they are the \"C style\" and \"Fortran style\". NumPy uses the \"C style\" by default which is what we saw above:"

In this case, we can't have a 3x3 window at the edges of the image, so I'm just going to cut those off with our final shape being `(398, 398, 3, 3)` (but you could just pad the image with 0's to apply the filter at the edges if you wanted to).
